# Web-application-Ontology-editor

Ontology     OWL 2      OWL API     JAVA     Bootstrap

The project aims to implement a web-based interface that uses the OWL API provided by Protege as the business layer to store ontologies and record instances. Initial developments will focus on providing the users with a web-based application for recording ontologies and instances.Â The web-based ontology editor should allow user to create, edit, browse ontologies and instances.The next step is to develop representative ontologies in culture and heritage domain.
Apart from implementing basic functionality in a web-based ontology editor, the project requires further implementations in either Semantic web service, Rule-based reasoning, ontology visualization or ontology mapping.
